Because it was being penetrated by the will-o'-the-wisp!\n   \n\n   \n**Generate a surreal error message**:\n\n::\n\n   >>> import surrealism\n   >>> surr = surrealism.Surrealism()\n   >>> sen = surr.getfault()\n   \n   >>> jump-lead .c:147: sleepy error before 'stick insect' - 'salt crystal' undeclared.\n   \n   \nStill to do:\n\n- Add ability to read nested #RANDOM elements\n- Add the ability to be able to re-use nouns and verbs in the same sentence rather than generating new ones.\n- Add more sentences to the database."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1544}]],"length":1544}
