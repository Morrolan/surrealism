Changelog
---------

1.0.1
-----
New numbering system that makes sense to people!  Rewrote large portions to do away with the requirement for SQLite.  The required C extensions were causing problems using surrealism with AWS Lambda.

0.13.2
-----
Minor fixes to unittest suite.

0.13.1
-----
Minor change to facilitate issue with corrupt upload to pypi.

0.13.0
-----
Internal refactoring and name cleanup.  Public methods have had underscores added to their names, but old names preserved for backwards-compatibility.  Also changed show_sentences to return a dict instead of a tuple of tuples.

0.12.0
-----
Changed structure and moved code from __init__.py to surrealism.py.  Fixed a few potential bugs with capitalisation of words and sentences.


0.11.3
-----
Fixes to sursentences database table entries.


0.11.2
-----
Minor bug fixes.


0.11.1
-----
Fixed minor issue with single-letter capitalisation.  Need to work on whole-sentence capitalisation and maybe rewrite how it works (stick it in brackets etc).


0.11.0
-----
Added 2 new functions - showsentences and showfaults which allow you to pick and choose sentences.  I also changed faulttest and sentencetest to return their output as a list of tuples instead of printing them, allowing for more options to the user.


0.10.2
-----
Small change to fix issue with repeating segments and random elements causing bracket matching errors.


0.10.1
-----
No code change - disabled one problematic sentence in the database.


0.10.0
-----
Finally added the functionality to allow repeating segments.


0.9.5
-----
Fixed a few minor DB issues.


0.9.4
-----
Fixed a bug where #CAPITALISE wasn't being replaced properly.


0.9.3

0.9.2
-----

0.9.1
-----
Fixes to improve Exception generation.


0.9.0
-----
Added the ability to override getfault() and getsentence() allowing you to now specify a fault_id or sentence_id from within the database. 


0.8.0
-----
Added comments to code and fixed some dodgy sentences in the database.


0.7.0
-----
Added a new table which allows more faults rather than just the C++ syntax fault.  Also added faulttest() and sentencetest() so you can print out all sentences and faults.

Added the ability to have the entire sentence in uppercase (some sentences require it) and tripled the size of the 'names' table.

-----
More database tweaks to fix spacing issues.
