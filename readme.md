Usage Examples
--------------

**Generate a surreal sentence**:

::

   >>> import surrealism
   
   >>> sentence = surrealism.getsentence()
   
   >>> print sentence
   
   >>> If I can get the Pot Noodle to enter Radiohead's Lead Singer, the lego-brick will dilute Julian Assange and I'll be able to spy on Neil Armstrong!

You can also specify an integer representing the relevant row ID from the database in order to return a specific sentence:

::

   >>> import surrealism
   
   >>> sentence = surrealism.getsentence(39)
   
   >>> print sentence
   
   >>> Don't drop things on X-Wings - get blood out of deep-fat friers!

   
**Generate a surreal error message**:

::

   >>> import surrealism
   
   >>> print surrealism.getfault()
   
   >>> thing.c:466: fearsome error in 'blow-up doll()' - missing thing-a-ma-jig.

You can also specify an integer representing the relevant row ID from the database in order to return a specific sentence:

::

   >>> import surrealism
   
   >>> print surrealism.getfault(3)
   
   >>> Traceback (most recent call last):  File '/party popper/fighter plane/glistening_seashell/anti-depressant.py', line 20, in straggly_particle accelerator.  waterproofError: salmon mousse did not deep-fry hand-drill.

Errors
------

If you try to pass a non-integer into either function, you will generate a *SurrealError*.  This is defined as a standard *Exception* and therefore can be handled appropriately.
